Using Node.js and MySQL to create a "department store" where people can order items (if in stock). There's also a module for "Managers" of the store to view inventory and make necessary changes. Changes include adding more stock to a currently sold item or adding a whole new item to sell. Later on, I will be adding another feature to determine profits based on department sales. This will require a second table using JOINS, GROUP BYs and ALIASES. I can also add a small function or method to have the user continue using the program if he/she wants to or quit. For now...this is kosher.
